# Creates two commands that interact with each other

This application registers a [ShellUI module](http://developer.m-files.com/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Modules/#shellui) that creates two commands (one initially hidden).  Clicking the first command shows the second command).  Clicking the second command disables itself.

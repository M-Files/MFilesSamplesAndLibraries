# M-Files UIX Sample Applications

Information on the available UIX applications is available [on the M-Files Developer Portal](http://developer.m-files.com/Samples-And-Libraries/Samples/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/).

## Versions

This repository contains examples for Version 2 - the latest version of the UIX Framework - and for Version 1.

New development should target Version 2.  Version 2 of the UIX is supported in M-Files Web and the new M-Files Desktop client.  These newer clients do not support Version 1 applications.

Version 1 of the UIX is considered legacy and should only be used when explicitly targeting the M-Files Classic Web or M-Files Classic Desktop clients.  These classic clients do not support Version 2 applications.
